# DECISIONS

Log of implementation decisions, per the plan's cross-cutting rules. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-06-09 — M0

- **three pinned exact at 0.184.0** (`@types/three@0.184.1`), per the plan's "pin Three.js per milestone" risk mitigation. Vite 8, TypeScript 5.8, pnpm workspace.
- **One root `tsconfig.json` drives typecheck** for `packages/*` and `content/` (no project references). `@loom/runtime` resolves via tsconfig `paths` + a Vite alias in `engine-app/vite.config.ts` — the alias is what lets `content/` scenes (which live outside any package) import the runtime.
- **Vite HMR error overlay disabled** (`server.hmr.overlay: false`): a compile error must never paint over the Output window. Compile errors are withheld by Vite (previous module keeps running); runtime throws are contained by `SceneHost.setScene` try/catch.
- **M0 error containment boundary:** TS/parse errors and `build()` throws are contained. A scene whose *shader* fails at GPU compile time after a successful build() is not yet contained — that's part of NFR-2 work in M1's per-instance containment.
- **Validation is screenshot-based** (Playwright + pngjs): reading a WebGL/WebGPU canvas via `drawImage` returns black without `preserveDrawingBuffer`, so acceptance checks sample composited page screenshots instead. Headless Chromium has no WebGPU adapter → automated runs exercise the WebGL2 fallback path; WebGPU is verified manually in desktop Chrome.
- **Validation artifacts committed** under `loom/artifacts/` as evidence for each milestone run.

## 2026-06-09 — M1

- **Kernel is pull-based with per-frame memoization.** `Signal.get(f)`/`Events.poll(f)` memoize on `f.frame`. Consequence: stateful ops (lag, envelope, divide, quantize, onset detectors) must be pulled every frame or they miss time — instances guarantee this because every CPU signal reaches the GPU through a registered uniform updater that runs each frame. Documented as a contract, not a bug.
- **`TexNode.color` is strictly `Node<"vec4">`.** Looser unions (float/vec3) fight @types/three conversion overloads and push casts into every effect. Sources normalize to vec4 once.
- **Effects own pass ordering.** A stateful effect (feedback) returns `[...input.passes, ownPass]` — topological order falls out of composition; the Instance just runs the list. No graph scheduler until one is actually needed.
- **Feedback render targets are fixed 1280×720 half-float.** Per-instance sizing belongs to M3 (Stage/panes); resolution-independent history would complicate the first stateful pass for no M1 payoff.
- **Synthetic test-audio mode lives in AudioBus** (`?audio=test`, also the automatic fallback when getUserMedia fails). Scheduled kick + offbeat hats feed the same AnalyserNode path as the mic, so validation and demos exercise the real analysis code. This is a stopgap for M5 fixtures (record/replay InputBus traces), not a replacement.
- **BPM is manual (set via `?bpm=` / tap on `t`)** per plan; beat tracking from audio is explicitly post-v1.
- **Onset detection** = threshold + rising edge + refractory + re-arm-below-threshold, per detector instance (each `ctx.audio.onset()` call gets independent state/options). Spectral-flux fanciness deferred until kicks feel missed in practice.
- **Validation scripts fail fast if Vite exits early** (port collision) — an aborted run once left an orphan server and the next run silently validated against its stale module graph.
- **NFR-5 rebuild semantics in `trySwap`:** build the next instance fully before disposing the old one; a failed build never touches the running instance.
