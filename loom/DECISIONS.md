# DECISIONS

Log of implementation decisions, per the plan's cross-cutting rules. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-06-09 — M0

- **three pinned exact at 0.184.0** (`@types/three@0.184.1`), per the plan's "pin Three.js per milestone" risk mitigation. Vite 8, TypeScript 5.8, pnpm workspace.
- **One root `tsconfig.json` drives typecheck** for `packages/*` and `content/` (no project references). `@loom/runtime` resolves via tsconfig `paths` + a Vite alias in `engine-app/vite.config.ts` — the alias is what lets `content/` scenes (which live outside any package) import the runtime.
- **Vite HMR error overlay disabled** (`server.hmr.overlay: false`): a compile error must never paint over the Output window. Compile errors are withheld by Vite (previous module keeps running); runtime throws are contained by `SceneHost.setScene` try/catch.
- **M0 error containment boundary:** TS/parse errors and `build()` throws are contained. A scene whose *shader* fails at GPU compile time after a successful build() is not yet contained — that's part of NFR-2 work in M1's per-instance containment.
- **Validation is screenshot-based** (Playwright + pngjs): reading a WebGL/WebGPU canvas via `drawImage` returns black without `preserveDrawingBuffer`, so acceptance checks sample composited page screenshots instead. Headless Chromium has no WebGPU adapter → automated runs exercise the WebGL2 fallback path; WebGPU is verified manually in desktop Chrome.
- **Validation artifacts committed** under `loom/artifacts/` as evidence for each milestone run.
